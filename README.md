# Credit_Card_Validation
This project is a credit card eligibility assessment tool that utilizes a Random Forest classifier to predict whether an individual is likely to get approved for a credit card or not. It employs machine learning techniques to analyze various features and assess the creditworthiness of the applicant.

## Usage
To use this credit card eligibility assessment tool, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have the trained Random Forest model and the dataset of credit card applicants.
Update the path to the dataset in the Application.py file.
Run the Credit.ipynb file
The program will load the trained Random Forest model and prompt you to enter the applicant's details.
The program will process the applicant's details using the Random Forest model and predict whether the individual is likely to get approved for a credit card or not.
